<br />
8.7.1 Blog package clients can select an 'auto-publish' option, which enables posts to be pushed live directly to their blog. <br />
<br />
8.7.1.2 Clients who select this option consent to posts being published directly to their site with an image of our choice.

<br />
8.7.1.3 Clients also consent to approve orders which are auto-published instantly, which means that once live, they wave the right to request any edits to these posts once they have been published on their blog.<br />
<br />
8.8 Should payment be missed due to lack of funds, credit/debit card expiration or any other reason, Copify will notify the client by email and offer them the opportunity to update their billing details. Until such a time as new, correct information is issued by the client, blog posts will cease to be delivered. <br />
<br />
