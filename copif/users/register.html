We reserve the right to uphold or reject complaints at our sole discretion.

7.2.1 If, once the writer has amended the copy, the client is still unhappy, they should escalate the case with the Copify support team by emailing 'help at copify dot com' with the order ID and details of their objections.

7.2.2 The Copify support team will review the brief issued by the the client, the copy and any communication between the two parties.

If it is deemed that the copy matches the specification outlined in the first instance then we reserve the right to reject the complaint. 

7.2.3 If the client is unwilling to have their copy written by another writer, we will refund the cost of their order, in full, providing this request is made no more than 60 days after the order is placed.

8 Blog Package Terms and Conditions

8.1 Clients who sign up for a blog package are bound by the following terms and conditions.

8.2 After signing up, clients will be billed for and receive the requested number of blog posts within one calendar month. They will be billed the same amount every calendar month and receive the same agreed number of blog posts until they change or cancel their subscription through the Copify website.

8.2.1 We reserve the right change the monthly billing amount of blog packages at any time, with our prior warning or consent.

8.2.2 The billing amount paid by clients includes VAT charged at the standard UK rate of 20%. Clients outside of the UK who are VAT registered within the E.U. are eligible to be billed for a blog package at their country's rate of taxation, providing they supply their company details and VAT registration number before they sign up for a package, and they ensure that the package they subscribe to is a custom package, which can be created at the following page: https://uk.copify.com/packages/tools. VAT information must be entered in the Profile section of user accounts under the 'Billing' tab. Copify is not liable to issue rebates to clients who sign up for standard blog packages or those who enter VAT information after signing up for a blog package.

8.3 Cancellation requests must be issued before the date of the clientâ€™s billing cycle, otherwise clients are liable for another month of billing and service delivery.

8.4 Clients can change their package at any time, providing this is before their monthly billing date. Requests made on this date may not be actioned until the following month.

8.5 It is the clientâ€™s responsibility to ensure that the information concerning their required blog posts is correct. Copify is not liable for mistakes arising from either misinformation, or a lack of information provided by the client.

8.6 Copify reserves the right to embellish information supplied by clients for the purposes of supplying writers with an adequate brief to write blog posts.

8.7 Copify will supply all posts in a number of formats for clients to download and publish to their blogs but accepts no responsibility for compatibility issues which may arise from unsupported platforms or content management systems.

8.7.1 Blog package clients can select an 'auto-publish' option, which enables posts to be pushed live directly to their blog. 

8.7.1.2 Clients who select this option consent to posts being published directly to their site with an image of our choice. Whilst every effort is made to ensure that the information and image contained in these posts is accurate and free from mistakes, Copify accepts no responsibility or liability for text or images which are deemed by clients to be inappropriate, inaccurate or offensive. 

8.7.1.3 Clients also consent to approve orders which are auto-published instantly, which means that once live, they wave the right to request any edits to these posts once they have been published on their blog.

8.8 Should payment be missed due to lack of funds, credit/debit card expiration or any other reason, Copify will notify the client by email and offer them the opportunity to update their billing details. Until such a time as new, correct information is issued by the client, blog posts will cease to be delivered. 

8.8.1 If new billing details are entered, a new billing cycle will begin from that date.

8.9 Clients who are unhappy with orders that are delivered to them must follow the dispute resolution process, as outlined in section 7.
