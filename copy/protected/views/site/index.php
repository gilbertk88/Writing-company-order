                    <p class="lead">Search Engine Optimization, otherwise referred to as SEO, is the process by which one takes their website to the top of the search engine results for organic search. In other words, SEO is the process by which you make changes to your own website, as well as those of others, to ensure that your website gains authority and thus is listed on top of the leading search engines for the terms that relate to your business. The foundation to making this happen for the long term is to have website content that adheres to the SEO basics.</br></br>

Below are the check-points for this kind of web content</br></br>

<strong>Informative and Quality Content</strong></br></br>

In order to achieve the best SEO results, you must start by having very informative, engaging and top quality content for your website. In other words, you must have the right articles, photos, videos and presentations on your site that will capture your potential clients’ interest. This content should keep the website visitors on your website longer while also making them to want to come back regularly to your site for more such content.</br>

<strong>Authoritative Content</strong></br></br>

The content should also bring you out as an authority in your area of business/expertise while also connecting with your ideal customer. This is achieved via the language that you use for the content; it should be lay enough for the layman to understand, yet professional enough to communicate authority and experience. At the same time, it should be free of unnecessary jargon, yet fully detailed and informative.</br>

<strong>Keyword-Centered </strong></br></br>

The content of your website should revolve around specific terms that your potential customers use when searching for your product/service. These terms are referred to as keywords. A keyword-based article on your website stands a better chance of being indexed and listed on top of the search engine results for organic (free) search. This brings in more targeted customers to your business.</br>

<strong>Pre-Sell, Don’t Sell</strong></br></br>

Good to note here is that whenever you are writing your web content, you should avoid selling to your potential customers. Instead, provide information, tell them about the benefits of using your products/services, and educate them on how to use your services. This is called pre-selling. While at it, ensure that you take care of the search engines ranking algorithms. This way, you will end up with search engine optimized web content.</br></br>

Search engine optimized web content is done around specific keywords (words that your potential customers use while searching for your products/services). These keywords should be buyer keywords, meaning that they should be words that a potential buyer of your service/product would use when searching to purchase your product. This reduces the chances of an ordinary browser from landing on your website. Instead, you only get traffic (visitors to your website) who can be easily converted to buyers.</br>

<strong>A Call to Action</strong></br></br>

Besides being highly optimized for the search engines, your website content should also have a very clear call to action. This is what converts visitors to buyers. The call to action may be a simple “sign up to our newsletter”, or a “click here to learn more about our services”, to a more pronounced “buy now”  or “click to add to cart” statement. Basically, make sure you guide your website visitor to perform the action you want them to take on.</br></br>
